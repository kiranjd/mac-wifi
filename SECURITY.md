## Reporting

Please report security issues privately to the maintainer before opening a public issue.

## Secret Handling

This repository intentionally avoids committing certificates, private keys, provisioning profiles,
or passwords. Release scripts are environment-driven.

## History Note

Repository history is retained. If any signing material or credentials ever appeared in historical commits,
treat them as compromised and rotate/revoke them outside this repository.
